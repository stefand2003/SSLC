        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>With this website I have tried to deliver a user-friendly and responsive experience for all users to promote
          inclusiviy. I started building the mobile version of the website to embrace the "Mobile-First Responsive Web
          Design" to make sure that my website fits all different devices.
          With that being said I aim to provide a rather practical, useful and serious website whilst still promoting
          cheerful content that could be seen by the design and the images I have decided to use.
        </p>
        <p>I have a used breakpoints to create various screen sizes, from mobile to desktop and something in between
          (tablet mode between around 800px). I have tried to offer a constant design on all pages to ensure visually
          appealing user experience. I am mostly fond of my navigation menu as it is making content easily accessible on
          all screensizes.</p>

        <h2>Site Map</h2>
        <p>My website is composed of pages such as: Home, Purpose, Membership, Meetings & Papers and Contact Us. This
          layout in the navigation allows easy navigation for users. At the footer I have provided the links to pages
          such as Accessibility, Legal & Security, Design(current page), Testing and Credit page. This is to outline
          that the website compiles with all the rules to make it ethical for people to use and view.</p>

        <img src="./assets/basicPrincipleResize.png" alt="basicPrincipleResize-diagra-writtenBy-myself-Stefan-Dimitrov"
          id="myDiagram">
        <p>Basic Diagram written by Stefan Dimitrov to address the concept of resizing and what I have used to create
          the website responsiveness. It also includes max-widths to make things responsive and as well as that %. Most
          of my images have width as a percentage e.g 90% or 100% to ensure responsiveness.</p>


        <h2>Design Reasoning</h2>
        <p>I have decided to only include 2 breakpoints both being (min-width: 400px) and (min-width:800px) as apposed
          to having 3 different breakpoints at 600, 900 or 1200 because the points that are affected by the min-width
          will display inheritance when screen resizes. For instance, when in my css I had a display flex as a column in
          the 400px format it would be inherited in the 800px + format so in order to keep all the same design but lets
          say I wanted to change the column into a row i just have to mention `fled-direction: row` in the 800px +
          format and would not only obey but also keep the way I have styled my previous componnet - it wouldn't change
          the width or the size of image or go back to default css, which it would have if I have used the
          (max-width:400px) and (min-width:800px). I have also made sure to use green background with white font color
          in order to promote readability and accessibility to all users.
        </p>

        <h2>Menu System</h2>
        <p>My responsive menu system incorporates a "hamburger" icon for mobile devices, offering a way to access the
          navgation links. On larger screens, the menu transforms into a horizontal navigation bar for the user
          conviences. After Learning JavaScript in the second half of the first semester, I am hoping to make the
          navigation menu appear and disappear when user clicks hamburger icon. </p>
